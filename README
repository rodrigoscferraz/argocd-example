This repo holds the necessary manifests to create a k8s cluster and enable GitOps through ArgoCD.
The layout I'm using is the well known "App of apps" that enables you to bootstrap an entire cluster from a single ARgocD "Application". It has a concise structure that help us leverage most of the capabilities of ArgoCD.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- `Docker`
- `kubectl`
- `k3d`

Some other tools will be installed along the way but they are not `required`.

Create a new kubernetes cluster using k3d:

```shell
k3d cluster create argocd-cp \
--api-port 6443 \
-p 8080:80@loadbalancer \
-p 8443:443@loadbalancer \
--agents 3
--k3s-arg "--disable=traefik@server:0"
```

> at least 3 nodes are necessary to install argo with HA

Create the necessary infra for ArgoCD:

```shell
kubectl apply -k infra/argocd/base
```

> if you need another version of argocd please update [this](./infra/argocd/base/kustomization.yaml) file with the link of the yaml manifest at the version you want.

Install argocd cli:

```shell
VERSION=<TAG> # Select desired TAG from https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases
curl -sSL -o argocd-linux-amd64 https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/download/$VERSION/argocd-linux-amd64
sudo install -m 555 argocd-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argocd
rm argocd-linux-amd64
```

Kustomize might also be helpful to get a view of the manifest resulting from multiple overlays and debuging so let's install it:

```shell
curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/master/hack/install_kustomize.sh"  | bash
```

Get Argocd initial password:

```shell
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```
